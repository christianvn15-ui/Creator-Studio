# Creator Studio PWA

Creator Studio is a **progressive web app (PWA)** built for creative designers, inventors, and developers.  
It’s an all‑in‑one workspace where you can **plan ideas, take notes, design in 3D, write code, and manage projects** — fully offline‑ready and installable on mobile or desktop.

## ✨ Features

- **AI Planner**  
  Brainstorm and structure your ideas with a built‑in AI planning assistant.

- **Notes & Projects**  
  Organize ideas into projects. Each project can have multiple notes saved with custom titles inside modals.

- **3D Sandbox**  
  Draw, design, and explore objects in 3D. Orbit, zoom, and pan around cubes, spheres, and more — like handling real objects.

- **Code Space**  
  Write, save, and preview code in multiple formats (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, text).  
  Includes live preview for web code.

- **Profile & Library**  
  Upload a profile picture, set your display name and bio, and view all your projects.  
  A built‑in library modal acts as a file manager for projects, notes, files, scenes, and profile data.

- **Offline & Installable**  
  Works offline with service worker caching. Installable on mobile/desktop via PWA manifest.
